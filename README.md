## Email Replier with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project is a web application that leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create an intelligent email replier. Users can upload .msg, .pdf, .txt, and .docx files. The application extracts text from these files, identifies questions within the text, and generates accurate and context-aware answers using OpenAI's GPT-35-turbo model.
